# my-landing-page

This challenge was all about creating my own landing page and seeing what I could get accomplished creatively. I spent a lot of time learning about different kinds of css techniques such as css grid and spacing. This challenge was all about creating a website that would display a little about ourselves, our work, and our contact information.
